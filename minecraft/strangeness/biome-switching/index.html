<h2>Can this be explained?</h2>

<img src="2020-12-03_08.21.42_PC.png">
<img src="2020-12-03_08.26.23_Linux.png">
<br/><br/>

The image on the left is from my PC connected as a client over to my Linux machine.  The image on the right is the Linux machine hosting the world.<br/>
(Although my PC is newer and more powerful, I sometimes get lazy and just play directly on the Linux machine.)<br/><br/>

As you can see the screenshots are nearly identical:
<ul>
  <li>Same versions of Minecraft (different hardware and Java versions).</li>
  <li>Same account, but only the PC <b>OR</b> the Linux is actively playing in the world.</li>
  <li>Same data files.</li>
  <li>Same coordinates.</li>
  <li>Different biomes reported.</li>
</ul>

About two weeks prior, I reported something similar as a potential bug
(<a href="https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-205643" target="_blank">https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-205643</a>) because I would notice, on the PC, the changing of the biome 
names as I went up and down the Y-axis in a straight line.  If I played that same world in Linux, the biomes did not change along the Y-axis.  I didnt really pay attention to that 
difference between PC and Linux until now.
<br/><br/>

So my questions are:
<ol>
  <li>Why is there a discrepancy with the biomes between computers?</li>
  <li>Which biome information should I trust?</li>
  <dd>The reason for this question is because I am strip-mining the Mushroom biome (where my homebase is).  I do not want to expose my underground to hostile mobs, so I dig as
  up against the border of the biomes.</dd>
</ol>
