<h2>Can this be explained?</h2>

<br/><br/>

The image on the left is from my PC connected as a client over to my Linux machine.  The image on the right is the Linux machine hosting the world.<br/>
(Although my PC is newer and more powerful, I sometimes get lazy and just play directly on the Linux machine.)<br/><br/>

As you can see the screenshots are nearly identical:
<ul>
  <li>Same versions of Minecraft (different hardware and Java versions).</li>
  <li>Same account, but only the PC <b>OR</b> the Linux is actively playing in the world.</li>
  <li>Same data files.</li>
  <li>Same coordinates.</li>
  <li>Different biomes reported.</li>
</ul>

About two weeks prior, I reported something similar as a potential bug
(<a href="https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-205643" target="_blank">https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-205643</a>) because I would notice, on the PC, the changing of the biome 
names as I went up and down the Y-axis in a straight line.  If I played that same world in Linux, the biomes did not change along the Y-axis.  I didnt really pay attention to
that difference between PC and Linux until now.
<br/><br/>

So my questions are:
<ol>
  <li>Why is there a discrepancy with the biomes between computers?  (Why even switch biomes along the Y-axis in the first place?!)</li>
  <li>Which biome information should I trust?</li>
  <dd>The reason for this question is because I am strip-mining the Mushroom biome (where my homebase is).  I do not want to expose my underground to hostile mobs, so I dig 
  up against the border of the biomes.  This leads me to un-answered question I posted as a comment in MC-205643:</dd>
  <li>If the biome is not Mushroom, could a mob spawn mid-air?</li>
  <dd>At Y=5 if the reported biome is not Mushroom, I wall it up and move on (as seen on the right-side of the screenshots).  But if Y=5 and Y=7 are open-air Mushroom, while Y=6
  is open-air non-Mushroom, could something a mob spawn and fall down to Y=5?</dd>
  <dd>Or look at from the POV of the above screenshots:  I am standing at -555,7,-361. It could be ocean or mushroom, but -555,8,-361 and -555,9,-361 are open-air.  Could a mob 
  spawn at Y=7?</dd>
</ol>
