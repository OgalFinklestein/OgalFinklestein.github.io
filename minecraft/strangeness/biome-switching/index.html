<h2>Can this be explained?</h2>

The image on the left is from my PC connected as a client over to my Linux machine.  The image on the right is the Linux machine hosting the world.<br/>
(Although my PC is newer and more powerful, I sometimes get lazy and just play directly on the Linux machine.)<br/><br/>

As you can see the screenshots are nearly identical:
<ul>
  <li>Same versions of Minecraft (different hardware and Java versions).</li>
  <li>Same data files.</li>
  <li>Same coordinates.</li>
  <li>Different biomes reported.</li>
</ul>

About two weeks prior, I reported something similar as a potential bug
(<a href="https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-205643" target="_blank">https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-205643</a>) because I would notice, on the PC, the changing of the biome 
names as I went up and down the Y-axis in a straight line.  If I played that same world in Linux, the biomes did not change along the Y-axis.  I didnt really pay attention to that 
difference between PC and Linux until now.
